This is a benchmark for syncing the mainnet chain from an external node.

1. start the trace acceptor in a terminal: `./trace-acceptor.sh`

2. start the local node in another terminal: `./chain-sync_mainnet.sh`


All data are kept in the directory `state-node-mainnet`. See the README file there how to extract metrics and plot them.

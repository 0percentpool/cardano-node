This is a benchmark for syncing the mainnet chain from an external or local node.

In case you choose to sync from a local node, make sure that 'cardano-byron-proxy' is running and listening on port 7777 of localhost.
The script `./prepare-byron-proxy.sh` updates the code of the byron-proxy and compiles it using 'cabal'.
Then, run the local proxy with the script `./launch_mainnet_proxy.sh`.

Run the benchmark using the script './benchmark-chain-sync-mainnet.sh'

It will run until maximum CPU time is used. Adapt this limit in the script file.
